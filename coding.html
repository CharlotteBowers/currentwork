		<h4>Coding languages I know</h4>
			<p>The languages that I currently know and am fairly confident in are:
<br>
<br>JavaScript: 
<br>A large amount of my work at the moment is JavaScript based. I mainly use it within Google Apps Script to build small workflows or backend programs to help my company become more efficient. 
<br></br>HTML/CSS: 
<br>Although I have not professionally used HTML and CSS as of yet, I’m fairly confident with them.
<br></br>Java: 
<br>I only know the very basics of Java and have only used it to make simple structures like a shopping cart and a clock. However it’s definitely a language that I’m fond of and would love to further my knowledge within it.

<br></br>SQL: Once again, I have not used this in a professional environment however I am fairly confident I would be able to carry out tasks that require SQL.

		<h4>Coding languages I would like to know</h4>
	The languages and libraries that I would love to learn are:

<br></br>Python: 
<br>Python is used very often within the company I’m employed by and I’m amazed by the things that it can do and be used for. With it being an object-oriented language there’s a number of things that it can be used for. 
<br></br>Ruby:
<br>Quite simply for the same reasons that I want to learn Python. Yet another object-oriented that is fairly popular.
<br></br>React.js:
<br>React.js is simple but so powerful, it makes websites quicker and more user friendly. 
<br></br>PHP/ASP: 
<br>Essential for the web developer! That’s when static can then become dynamic.

<h4>Links I find useful</h4>

Some useful links for learning code:

<br></br><a href=”https://www.codecadamy.com”>Codecademy</a>
<br>If you’re new to coding and need to hear it being taught in your own language and not alien then Codecademy is the place for you! It makes the basics of coding look easy and has forums just incase you get stuck. Although they don’t have every coding language on there yet, they’re looking to expand their courses and the courses currently available are good quality.
<br></br><a href=”https://www.freecodecamp.com”>Free Code Camp:</a>
<br>Unlike Codecademy, this goes into more detail. Where Codecademy gives you the basics and a place to carry out your practise, Free Code Camp tells you how to set up your own projects and deploy them. Not to mention you get a certificate that’s actually worth something if you put in the hours!

<br></br><a href=”https://stackoverflow.com”>Stack Overflow</a>
<br>A must for developers of all. This is a platform to go for help or to help other people with any kind of coding problem.
<br></br><a href=”https://jsfiddle.net”> jsfiddle</a>
<br>This is a brilliant site to go if you need a space to mess about or test HTML/CSS/JS and don’t want to be opening a million programmes, it makes it easy to edit and see the result. Goes hand in hand with learning from Codecademy.
